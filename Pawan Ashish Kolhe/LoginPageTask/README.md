## DOCUMENTATION

### Approach

My aim with this form design was to make an elegant user interface (UI) that would fit well with the logo of IncubateIND and have sharp edges as oppose to rounded. The user experience (UX) was something I focused on which includes making it easier for the user to understand what to enter into the input fields and visually guide the user using appropriate colors to indicate the status of the input.
